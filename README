README(1)                   General Commands Manual                  README(1)

NAME
       readme - README reader

SYNOPSIS
       readme [-cep] [dir]

DESCRIPTION
       readme displays to the standard output the header of the first found
       README* file in the current directory or in a directory up in the
       directory hierarchy.  If a directory is given as argument, use it in
       place of the current directory.

       The options are as follows:

       -c     Cat mode.  Rather than display only the head of the README file,
              displays it entirely.

       -e     Editor mode.  Edit the README file rather than displaying it.

       -p     Pager mode.  Display the README file in pager.

       All options are mutually exclusive.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables affect the execution of readme

       EDITOR, VISUAL
              Specifies an editor to use.  If both EDITOR and VISUAL are set,
              VISUAL takes precedence.  If neither EDITOR nor VISUAL are set,
              the default is vi(1).

       PAGER  Specifies the pager to use.  If it is not set, use more(1).

                                                                     README(1)
